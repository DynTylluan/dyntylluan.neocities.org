# Mirror of dyntylluan.neocities.org
Due to [my old website](https://owlman.neocities.org) having an open, Creative Comments license, it was (and still is) possible for people to mirror, edit, and build upon it, and that's exactly what Gwta did, who in 2018 made a Welsh translation of the website. As they used content from my own site which is [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0), it means that it uses the same license. The site itself was never finished, and in fact, it has now [been all but stripped of all of its contents](http://web.archive.org/web/20200908094730/https://dyntylluan.neocities.org) thanks to our friendship being over, but as [I already made a mirror of it on my website](https://owlman.neocities.org/dyntylluan), I thought I might as well do the same for [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/dyntylluan.neocities.org) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/dyntylluan.neocities.org), plus any other git mirrors.

Please be my guest if you want to carry on this translation project, but do keep in mind that a lot of the information on the original website is now outdated/straight-up incorrect, plus the HTML was always a mess.

This mirror was made thanks to me using [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com), grabbing the website on 2018-09-09. This was after the last update would be made, effectively making this the final version of the site.

# Disclaimer Regarding This Project
Just because I have mirrored a project by another person, this **does not mean** in any way, shape, or form that I agree or support the views of this project or even the person who made it, I have simply mirrored it for historical reasons as I have an interest in digital preservation. Over the years I have taken the time to archive many items, much of which can be seen [on my Internet Archive user page](https://archive.org/details/@14jammar). Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard text that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or is untrustworthy.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not affect the main part of the project in any way.
