# Mirror of dyntylluan.neocities.org
Due to [my website](https://owlman.neocities.org) having an open, Creative Comments license, it was (and still is) possible for people to mirror, edit, and build off of upon it, and that's exactly what Gwta did, who in 2018 made a Welsh translation of the website and as Gwta used content from my own site that is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, it means that dumb uses the same license. The site itself was never finished, and in fact it has now [been all but stripped of all of its contents](http://web.archive.org/web/20200908094730/https://dyntylluan.neocities.org/) thanks to our friendship being over, but as [I already made a mirror of it on my website](https://owlman.neocities.org/dyntylluan/), I thought I might as well do the same for [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/dyntylluan.neocities.org) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/dyntylluan.neocities.org).

If you want to carry on this translation project, please be my guest.

This mirror was made thanks to me using [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com), grabbing all of the site on 2018-09-09. This was after the last update would be made, effectively making this the final version of the site.
